## Data sets: 
- Tik Tok Trending Tracks: https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/tiktok-trending-tracks 
- Tik Tok Trending Videos: https://www.kaggle.com/erikvdven/tiktok-trending-december-2020 
- Spotify Top 50 Songs: https://www.kaggle.com/ritesh2000/spotify-top-50-most-streamed-songs

## Why we chose these data sets: 
### Tik Tok has become a worldwide sensation and our group was interested in learning more about it's impact on the music industry. We planned to discover a relationship between the video trends and and how it relates to top music charts.

## Proposed Methodology:
### Use Pandas to load in csv files in order to: 
- Join data (our chosen data sets)
- Clean data (drop null rows, etc)
- Filter data (possibly by artist names and song title)
